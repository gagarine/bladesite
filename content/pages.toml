Blades loads all the [TOML](https://toml.io) files (with the `.toml` extension) and [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org)
files (`.md` extension) with an optional TOML header (delimited by `+++` characters) from the content directory
specified in the [config](config.html) (defaults to `content`). In these files, the page content
and metadata are provided. They are then rendered using the provided [templates](templates.html).

When the file is called `index.toml` or `index.md`, the corresponding page is called **section**. The rendered page (`index.html`) is displayed
when the user browses to the parent URL. They can use some additional data in templates,
such as their subpages and subsections. Other files are treated as standard pages.

In pages (either in TOML files or in the header for Markdown files), these variables can be specified
(everything optional, default values shown):

<code class="highlighted">

*# Title of the page*
**title** = ""
*# Date when the page was created*
**date** = None
*# date = 2020-09-08*

*# An image representing the page*
**image** = ""
*# A brief summary of the page content*
**summary** = ""
*# The main content of the page*
*# [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) markdown can be used here*
*# In Markdown files, it is replaced with the actual content of the file, if present.*

**content** = \"\"\"
\"\"\"

*# A template to render this page with.*
*# If none is specified, the one specified in the [parent section](#sections) is used*
**template** = ""
*# A weight of the page, used if a collection this page is in is sorted by weight*
**weight** = 0
*# A priority of this page for SEO, in the range of 0-1*
**priority** = 0.5
*# Hide the page from the list of its parent's subpages or subsections*
**hidden** = false
*A list of alternative paths to render this page in, relative to the output directory*
**alternative_paths** = []

*# A template to render the gallery pictures with*
**gallery_template** = "gallery.html"

*# A list of pictures associated with this page*
*# Each will be rendered into a separate gallery page*
[[**pictures**]]
*# Id string of the picture, used for the generated URL in the gallery page*
*# MANDATORY for every picture used!*
**pid** = ""
*# An associated caption of the picture*
*# [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) markdown can be used here*
**caption** = ""
*# An alternative text displayed when the image can't be loaded of for accessibility*
**alt** = ""
*# File name of the image*
**file** = ""
*# Date and time of when the image was taken*
**taken** = None
*# Repeat for every picture*

*# A map of lists to classify this page with*
[**taxonomies**]
*# For example:*
*# tags = ["blades", "documentation"]*

*# Any "key = value" of any type can be used here for templates*
*# [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) markdown can be used for string fields here*
[**extra**]

## Sections
For pages that are sections, you can additionally specify these variables:

<code id="sections" class="highlighted">

*# A number of pages to paginate by, if this number is exceeded*
*# If provided, must be a positive integer*
**paginate_by** = âˆž
*# A template to render every subpage with (unless it specifies another template)*
**page_template** = "page.html"
*# A template to render every subsection with (unless it specifies another template)*
**section_template** = "section.html"
*# Sort subpages and subsetions by their provided weight, low to high*
*# By default, they are sorted by their date, newer to older*
**sort_by_weight** = false

</code>

## Not sections
For pages that are not sections, you can additionally specify these variables
(defaults are suggested):

<code class="highlighted">

*# The path in the output directory this page is rendered into*
**path** = {{ parent directory of the page within the content directory }}
*# The file name this page is rendered into, without the .html extension*
**slug** = {{ file name without the extension }}

</code>
